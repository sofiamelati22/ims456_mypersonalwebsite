	<img src="images/logokemas.jpeg" style="width="200px; height="200px">
	<p style="text-align: center">This is my kindergarten. I used to study here when i was 5 and 6 years old. <br>I still remember the time when my mom waited for me beside the window<br>of my class, peeping through inside the class just to stop me from crying. </p>

	<h2>2. SJK(C)Pooi Ming, Kuantan</h2>
	<img src="images/pooimingschool.jpeg" style="width="200px; height="200px">
	<p>This is my first primary school. My father send me into a chinese school <br>for me to learn mandarin language. It was so awkward when i first enter <br>the school and everyone was talking in mandarin language and i just stand <br>there don't know what to do. I was 7 years old during that time and i studied<br> here only until 8 years old before my family moved to Terengganu. I have <br>only 2 to 3 friends here since i don't know how to communicate with them.</p>

	<img src="images/chonghwaschool.png" style="width="200px; height="200px">
	<p>This is my second primary school when i first moved to Terengganu. <br>It was so fun here because i already know to speak in mandarin a little <br>bit when i first enter this school. I met my childhood friend here and she<br> had been my best friend until now. I started to know how to read, write <br>and speak in mandarin. It was easier for me to make friends since i already <br>understand the conversation. I was once resent my father for sending me <br>into an unfamiliar places but now, i'm thankful for the experience and knowledge<br> i've learned so far. I can speak mandarin fluently now.<br> I also have tons of chinese friends which i'm thankful for. </p>

	<img src="images/smteknikkuantan.png" style="width="200px; height="200px">
	<p>This is my secondary school. When i studied here, i need to stay at their <br>hostel when i was 16 to 17 years old. This is the time when i had my <br>SPM examination. It was a memorable experience when i'm forced to stay<br> at the hostel and be 100% independent. I need to do everything by myself without<br> my parents guidance. It was hard during the first few weeks but i'm adapting myself <br>well there. Probably because i was already 16 during that time. It was so enjoyable<br> to have my friends living together and studying together at one place. But sometimes <br>it was also quite stressful when i miss my family. I remember when the time <br>we are not allowed to go back home for 1 month and it was so stressful because<br> you only can call your family using public phone. <br>But all in all, in was a very memorable chilhood memory for me. </p>
